# chat-app

Simple chatapp using Node.js, vanilla javascript, html/css and the ws npm library with multi-room functionality and multi-user support.

## Setup

There is only a single dependency, and thats for websockets, currently things are installed using yarn, but npm should work fine.

```shell
# yarn users
yarn
# npm users
npm install
```

Then when you're ready, just use start and it should be on port 3000

```shell
# yarn users
yarn start
# npm users
npm start
```
